          Off the top of your head, can you name 3 local businesses in your
          area? If you can’t, don’t be surprised. As the COVID-19 pandemic
          continues, conglomerates are taking over the commerce world with their
          online prescence, strong branding, and variety of offerings, leaving
          small businesses behind in the dust. With GrowGreen, you can easily
          learn about and find small businesses nearby, and save your favorite
          ones, so you can revisit them later.
