## INSPIRATION ⭐
We were inspired, in part, by a statistic published by Mint, an Indian financial newspaper, on the large percentage of small businesses that have negatively been impacted by COVID-19. We hope that our app can bring more customers to their storefronts. 

## WHAT IT DOES 📝
When a user opens GrowGreen, they can find local, small businesses in their area with our integrated map. Tapping on the marker location for a store will pull up info on it, including but not limited to the store’s business hours, products offered, and contact info. If a user likes a particular business, they can favorite it, so that the next time they use GrowGreen, they can find that specific business’ info more quickly. 

## TECH STACK USED ⚙
*   Flutter (For building the App)
*	Firebase and Firestore (To maintain App database and accounts)
*	Google Maps API (For Google maps)
*   HTML, CSS, JS (For the website)
